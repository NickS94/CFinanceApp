CFinance: Crypto Currency Market Simulator


Welcome to CFinance! My name is Nick Stavropoulos, and I am a student at Syntax Institute in Berlin, Germany. This app is my final project for the Android module.
CFinance is developed in Kotlin using the Android Studio IDE.

About This App
The goal of CFinance is to provide a simulated environment for cryptocurrency trading.
It allows users to practice investing in cryptocurrencies without the risk of losing real money. This is particularly important in today's economy where financial security is crucial.

Transactions Screen: See all your transactions with detailed transaction screens.

Room Database: Save all your data, from account details to transactions and coins, using Room Databa
se.
Firebase Authentication and Registration: Securely register and log in with Firebase Authentication.

Please note that I am using the CoinMarketCap API Service, and my API key is not included in the code for security reasons.

Disclaimer
I am relatively new to programming, and my code may contain mistakes and may not be perfectly clean.
I am still in the process of learning and improving. 
Additionally, I am currently learning Swift programming language using Xcode IDE as part of the final module of my studies, which will be completed by October 7th.

Best regards,
Nick Stavropoulos
